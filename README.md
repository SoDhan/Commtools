# Commtools
R Package for Communications Toolbox( from Matlab).
It is an attempt to get communications toolbox to R which is a real need right away as there are many similar funtions in different R packages but not as we would feel home in matlab and r has a lot of inherent advantages as we know it will be a very important thing to do so. In this way communications researchers, academician, corporates will be benefited.
I Hope we get as many contributors as possible to finish this job soon.
